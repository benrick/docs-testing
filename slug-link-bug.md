[created a Telerik Analytics project]({{slug:getting-started-your-application}})

To receive data from an application you must surely first integrate Analytics into that application. This is a job for software developers. They can follow these [monitor integration guidelines]({{slug:integration-introduction}}) and only need the unique product key from step 1 to get started. Custom tracking can be added in abundance later, but initially we recommend just calling `Start` when your application starts and `Stop` when it stops.
